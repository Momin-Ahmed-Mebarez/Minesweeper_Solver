# Minesweeper_Solver

A python script to solve minesweeper

Limitations:

-Can only work with boards up to hint 3 
-May not win everytime
-Needs the user to know the region of the board



Features:
-Can be used with any minesweeper site or application as long as you change the pictures


Disclaimer: I used this script without making an account or trying to compete since it's clearly cheating and may get you banned use at your own risk. Even if there isn't any risk respect the rules and let everyone enjoy playing.

P.S: this project is made with the intention of just doing the job which is why it's not optimized nor documented probably.
